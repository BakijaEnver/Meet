# Meet
Social network for meeting (Android)
Smartphones are an inevitable part of todayâ€™s society. Therefore, every aspect of our lives is affected by new mobile technologies. Social Applications have become the main communication and socialization tools among individuals. The goal of this senior project is to develop a fully-functional, intuitive and easy to use App that enables users to communicate with other users connected to the same WiFi network.
People nowadays spend a lot of time in caffe bars and they usually do not socialize very much. This App will enable them to detect users connected to the same network and to establish a connection with them.
